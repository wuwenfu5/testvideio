在ubuntu中clock返回的时间不准，实测与time.time差三倍左右，在新版本中不推荐使用，实测process_time与clock一样误差
time.perf_counter()
Return the value (in fractional seconds) of a performance counter, i.e. a clock with the highest
available resolution to measure a short duration. It does include time elapsed during sleep and
is system-wide. The reference point of the returned value is undefined, so that only the difference
between the results of consecutive calls is valid.
New in version 3.3.

time.process_time()
Return the value (in fractional seconds) of the sum of the system and user CPU time of the current
process. It does not include time elapsed during sleep. It is process-wide by definition. The
reference point of the returned value is undefined, so that only the difference between the
results of consecutive calls is valid.
New in version 3.3.
